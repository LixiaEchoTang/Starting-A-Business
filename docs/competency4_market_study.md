## 4.1 Collect Secondary Data on the Market

### What is a Market?
A market is any one of a variety of systems, institutions, procedures, social relations, locations, and infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange. While parties may exchange goods and services by barter, most markets rely on sellers offering their goods or services (including labor) in exchange for money from buyers.

For more details, see: [Market Study Introduction](https://moodle.rsb.qc.ca/pluginfile.php/193058/mod_resource/content/1/Market%20Study%20Intro.pdf)

#### Identification of Markets
- **Place:** e.g., Jean Talon, eBay, Christmas Market in Longueuil
- **Consumer or Business:** e.g., car buyers, office supplies
- **Product:** e.g., automobile market, laptops, makeup

#### Concept Review
- **Marketing research:** The gathering and analyzing of data to provide a business with information on consumers’ needs and wants.
- **Data:** Raw material, numbers, facts, etc.
- **Information:** Data that has been evaluated, filtered, consolidated, analyzed, and organized for a specific purpose.

#### Market Research Process
1. **Defining the problem**
2. **Obtaining data**
3. **Analyzing the data**
4. **Recommending solutions**
5. **Applying the results**

#### Need for Market Research
- **Identify potential customers:** Who will use your product/service? (age, gender, marital status, children, location, education)
- **Understanding your existing customers:** Why do they choose your product? What do they value (service, quality, prestige)? Who influences their decisions?
- **Set realistic targets:** Use the data to determine growth, sales, and product/service introduction.
- **Develop effective strategies:** Inform decisions about pricing, distribution channels, media usage, or product development.
- **Examine and solve business problems:** For example, analyzing a drop in sales to determine if it’s due to reduced brand awareness, new competition, or substitute products.
- **Identify business opportunities:** Spotting underserved or un-serviced markets, or recognizing trends like population shifts or increases in education and leisure time.

#### Data Types
- **Primary Data:**  
  - Obtained for the first time (“first-hand”).
  - Collected specifically for the study.
  - More expensive to gather due to higher research, effort, and time investments.
- **Secondary Data:**  
  - Data that has already been collected for other purposes.
  - Reinterpreted for current research.
  - Generally less expensive because much of the work is already done.

## 4.1.2 Target Clientele

### Consumer Needs & Maslow’s Hierarchy
- **Needs:** Goods or services that are essential for life.
- **Wants:** Desires that enhance life beyond basic needs.

**Examples:**
- **House:** Need
- **Groceries:** Need
- **Dinner at The Keg:** Want
- **Nike running shoes:** Could be either need or want depending on context

According to Maslow, needs are organized in a pyramid, with lower levels needing satisfaction before higher ones can be activated. More details can be found on [Simply Psychology](http://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html).

### Consumer Markets
- **Consumer:** A person who uses the product.
- **Customer:** A person who buys the product.
- **Gatekeeper:** Typically a parent or guardian.

**Consumer Markets Refers To:**
- All customers interested in buying a particular product or service.
- Segments such as:
  - **Target Market:** Specific group of consumers aimed at by marketing efforts.
  - **Aggregate Market:** When the target is the whole market.
  - **Differentiated Markets:** Markets characterized by specific features.

Understanding the distinction between a need and a want is crucial in analyzing consumer demand, which can be affected by economic shifts, the introduction of new products, and other factors.

### Market Segmentation
- **Definition:** Dividing a market into groups of potential customers with similar needs or characteristics.
- **Bases for Segmentation:**
  - Geographic (e.g., urban, suburban, rural)
  - Demographic/Socio-economic (e.g., age, gender, income, education)
  - Psychographic (e.g., lifestyle, values, social class)
  - Behavioral (e.g., product usage, loyalty, occasions)
  - Product-related factors

#### Demographics
- **Age Cohorts:**  
  - 0-9: Pre-Customers  
  - 10-15: Allowance Customers  
  - 16-19: Youth Market  
  - 20-25: Post-Secondary  
  - 25-40: Family Formation  
  - 40-55: Establishment  
  - 55+: Mature Market  
  - Additional breakdown by generations (Baby Boomers, Generation X, Y, Z)

- **Gender, Income, Family Life Cycle, Culture/Ethnicity**  
  - Use various indicators such as postal codes, employment, education, property ownership, and number of children.

#### Geographic Segmentation
- **Urban:**  
  - Residents within city limits, commuters, smaller living spaces, spending on cultural events.
- **Suburban:**  
  - Typically commuters with larger living spaces and a need for personal transportation.
- **Rural:**  
  - Consumers who may require larger vehicles or farming equipment.

#### Psychographic and Behavioral Segmentation
- **Psychographics:**  
  - Dividing consumers based on lifestyle, personality, values, and social class.
- **Behavioral Segmentation:**  
  - Grouping consumers by their product knowledge, attitudes, and usage patterns.
- **Product-Related Segmentation:**  
  - Identifying consumers based on consumption amount, benefits sought, and usage quantity.

#### Family Life-Cycle Segmentation
- Segments based on different family stages (e.g., young and single, single parents, blended families, full nest, empty nest).

## Market Share Example

**Definition:** The percentage of one company’s sales relative to the total industry sales within a territory.

**Example Calculation:**

If the ACME company has $225,000 in sales within a $1,500,000 industry:  
\( \frac{225,000}{1,500,000} \times 100 = 15\% \)
