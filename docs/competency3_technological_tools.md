## 3.1. Find Information Online

### 7 Ways to Find What You Want on the Internet

1. **Vary Your Search Engine**  
   - The most widely used search engines are Google®, Bing®, and Yahoo®.  
   - Google usually has the largest catalog of pages and returns a broad variety of results.  
   - Bing offers more extensive autocomplete suggestions.  
   - Other engines like DuckDuckGo® and Dogpile® also have loyal followings.

2. **Use Specific Keywords**  
   - Make your keywords as specific as possible to narrow down results.  
   - Example: Instead of typing *stand design*, type *exhibition stand designer* to get more relevant results.  
   - Include your location if you need local services.

3. **Simplify Your Search Terms**  
   - Avoid “stop words” (e.g., *in*, *of*, *on*, *the*) unless they’re essential to the search.  
   - Use the simplest form of a word (e.g., *service* instead of *services*, *finance* instead of *financing*).

4. **Use Quotation Marks**  
   - Enclosing a search term in quotes prompts the engine to find that exact word or phrase.  
   - Example: Typing `"director"` avoids results for *direct* or *direction*.

5. **Remove Unhelpful Words**  
   - Insert a minus sign immediately before a word to exclude it from the results.  
   - Example: *marketing -digital* excludes *digital* from the results.

6. **Refine Your Search Using Operators**  
   - **Wildcard** (`*`): Use as a placeholder for unknown words.  
   - **OR**: Search for two or more terms simultaneously (e.g., *selling OR retailing*).  
   - **AND**: Combine terms (e.g., `"Smee Computers" AND "Devlin Corporation"`).  
   - **site:** Limits your search to a specific website (e.g., *site:mindtools.com "human resources"*).  
   - **related:** Finds websites similar to the one you specify (e.g., *related:xyz.com*).

7. **Avoid Search Pitfalls**  
   - Top results may have good SEO but not necessarily the best content.  
   - Dig deeper through the search results for more reliable information.

  - Check publication standards (e.g., peer-reviewed journals).

#### The CRAAP Test: Evaluating Sources

1. **Currency**: How recent is the information? Is it up to date?  
2. **Reliability**: Is the content factual or opinion-based? Are there references or citations?  
3. **Authority**: Who is the author/creator? What are their credentials?  
4. **Accuracy**: Is the information correct, verifiable, balanced, or peer-reviewed?  
5. **Purpose**: Is the intent to sell, persuade, or inform? Is there bias?
