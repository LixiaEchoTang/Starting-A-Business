# 1. The Four P’s of the Marketing Mix

**Product**  
- The goods or services a company offers to its target market.  
- In the context of a dog walking service, your “product” is the actual service of walking dogs, plus any additional offerings like pet sitting, playtime, or grooming add-ons.

**Price**  
- How much you charge for your product or service.  
- Includes not just the base fee but also any discounts, package deals, or premium pricing for special requests (e.g., walks during holidays or extra-long walks).

**Place**  
- How and where customers access your service.  
- For a dog walking business, this might refer to your service area within Montreal, any online platforms you use for scheduling, or partnerships with local pet stores or veterinary clinics.

**Promotion**  
- How you communicate your offerings to potential customers.  
- Could involve social media marketing, flyers in local neighborhoods, referral programs, or partnerships with pet-related businesses.

# 2. Stages in the Product Life Cycle

The traditional Product Life Cycle has four main stages (some models add a “Development” or “R&D” stage before introduction):

1. **Introduction**  
   - The product or service is launched.  
   - Sales are typically low, and marketing costs can be high as you work to build awareness.

2. **Growth**  
   - As awareness increases, sales rise quickly.  
   - Competitors may enter the market.  
   - You refine operations and possibly expand your offerings.

3. **Maturity**  
   - Growth slows, and the market may become saturated.  
   - Focus often shifts to differentiation and maintaining market share.

4. **Decline**  
   - Sales and profits begin to fall, possibly due to market shifts or new competitors.  
   - You may choose to innovate, pivot, or discontinue the offering.

*For a dog walking service, you might still be in the Introduction or Growth stage, working to build brand awareness and a loyal customer base. Over time, you’ll refine your offerings and possibly add new services (like dog grooming or pet sitting) as you move into Maturity.*

# 3. What is a Value Proposition?

A **value proposition** is a concise statement that explains:

- **What** your product or service is  
- **Who** it’s for (your target customers)  
- **How** it uniquely solves a problem or fulfills a need  
- **Why** it’s better or different from competing options  

For a dog walking service, a strong value proposition might highlight:

- Your reliability and trustworthiness  
- Special care or attention you provide (e.g., daily photo updates or personalized route planning)  
- Unique extras like training reinforcement or pet socialization  

By clearly stating how your dog walking service meets the needs of busy pet owners in Montreal better than other alternatives, you help potential customers understand why they should choose you.
