### Qualitative Objectives

- **Pros**: Encourages deeper understanding and detailed discussion about improvements.  
- **Cons**: Can be opinion-based or complex to measure.

### Quantitative Objectives
- **Description**: Goals that can be tracked with data and evidence.  
- **Pros**: Easy to measure, compare, and report.  
- **Cons**: Can be simplistic and may lack context if taken in isolation.

**Tim Hortons Example**  
- **Qualitative**: "Delivering the ultimate guest experience," "Embracing technology to be consumer-centric."  
- **Quantitative**: "Opening more than 800 locations by 2018," "Cumulative free cash flow of approximately $2 billion."
